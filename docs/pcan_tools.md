## `receivetest` - Receiving data over `CAN`

- Display up to 100 (extended and standard) messages received from the 1 st CAN port of a USB interface connected to a CAN bus at 1 Mbit/s:

  ```bash
  receivetest -f=/dev/pcanusbfd32 -e -n=100

## `transmitest` - Tool for sending data over `CAN`

- Create `transmit.txt` file with CAN data frames:

  ```bash
  # standard messages
  m s 0x7FF 0 # a comment
  m s 0x7FB 8 0x88 0x99 0xAa 0xbB 0xCc 0xdD 0xEe 0xfF     # a comment

  # same as extended message
  m e 0x1FFFFFFB 8 0x88 0x99 0xAa 0xbB 0xCc 0xdD 0xEe 0xfF

  # same as remote and standard message
  r s 0x008 8 0x88 0x99 0xAa 0xbB 0xCc 0xdD 0xEe 0xfF

  # same as remote and extended
  r e 0x00000008 8 0x88 0x99 0xAa 0xbB 0xCc 0xdD 0xEe 0xfF # a comment
  ```

- Transmit 100 times all the CAN 2.0 frames described in transmit.txt to the 1st CAN port of a USB interface connected to a CAN bus at 1 Mbit/s:

  ```bash
  transmitest transmit.txt -f=/dev/pcanusbfd32 -b=0x14 -e -n=100
